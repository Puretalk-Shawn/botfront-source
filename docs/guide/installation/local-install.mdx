# Setup

## Requirements

Botfront has a few technical requirements. See them [here](/docs/deployment/configuration/#indicative-minimal-technical-requirements).

- Linux or macOS (Windows may work but is not officially supported yet, [help is welcome](https://github.com/botfront/botfront/issues/115))
- Chrome (some issues with other browsers)
- A recent version of Docker
- A recent version of Node.js

## Install the Botfront CLI

```bash
npm install -g botfront
```

## Create a new project

```bash
botfront init
```

Botfront will prompt you for a folder name if the current directory is not empty

## Start Botfront

```bash
botfront up
```

When installation is completed, Botfront will propose you to create your first project.

At any time, you can access the Botfront menu to create or run a project by running `botfront` in your shell.
